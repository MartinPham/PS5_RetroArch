# PS5 RetroArch - build the frontend picker, /app0/picker/picker.bin (docs/FRONTENDS.md).
#
# The picker is a program of ../PS5_VulkanTemplate's UI module (frontends/picker/
# picker.cpp, in the kit's Gloss theme), so it is built the template's way, as the
# one program of a title the template generates:
#
#   1. ps5/tools/new-title.py --ui makes that title in build/picker/title, from the
#      template at the commit pinned here (it exports the commit, not the working
#      tree), with the template's .deps (the kit and the payload SDK it pins);
#   2. picker.cpp replaces the generated program, and three edits are made to the
#      generated build, each checked: its files live in /app0/picker (PS5_APP_ROOT
#      and the asset and shader folders), and its main calls ps5_title_next once
#      the program has ended, which restarts the title as the frontend chosen;
#   3. the template's ps5/tools/build.sh builds it against ../PS5_Vulkan (RADV and
#      the libc.prx this title also carries), and stages the notices of what it is
#      built from, reading those repositories beside this project's folder;
#   4. its eboot.bin is staged as picker/picker.bin, with the kit's assets and
#      shaders, and the two previews (assets/picker/*.png) as raw RGBA the picker
#      uploads as they are.
#
# Run by tools/build-title.sh when PS5_FRONTENDS names "picker", after the title
# folder is assembled. Inputs, overridable: PS5_VULKAN_TEMPLATE, PS5_VULKAN_DIR.
