/* The scraper: game metadata and media, kept on the console for every frontend.
 *
 * The store (<title>/library), one folder a system, named by the library's system id
 * (src/ps5_library.h), the id EmulationStation's systems are named by:
 *
 *     library/<system>/metadata/<game>.meta         key = "value" lines
 *     library/<system>/covers|screenshots|titlescreens|marquees|videos/<game>.<ext>
 *
 * <game> is the content's file name without its extension (a folder game's folder
 * name), as frontends name media. Every file is written under a hidden name and
 * renamed when whole: a cut download never replaces good media. What exists is kept
 * unless a job asks to overwrite, and a field edited by hand is never replaced.
 * Every frontend reads these same files, never a copy: RetroArch's thumbnail lookup
 * asks the store first (patch 0114, ps5_library_thumbnail), EmulationStation has the
 * store as its media folder and its game lists' fields from the .meta files, the
 * WebUI's games view reads them too; a future frontend calls ps5_library_media.
 *
 * Sources: libretro's thumbnail server (no account: covers, screenshots, title
 * screens) and ScreenScraper (every media type and the games' details; the user's
 * account, and this app's developer account, built in scrambled by
 * tools/build-webui-daemon.sh and sent over https only; never handed to a browser or a
 * PC helper, so ScreenScraper jobs run in PS5 mode). A ScreenScraper job keeps to the
 * account's thread count and pauses on a quota or a closed API, to be resumed.
 *
 * Jobs run in one of two ways, chosen by the user and remembered on the console:
 *   - "ps5": the console downloads, on worker threads of the server process, so a
 *     job goes on with no browser open (the WebUI daemon stays up while one runs);
 *   - "pc": the console identifies each game and hands out downloads as tasks; a
 *     helper on the PC (webui/ps5-media-helper.py) fetches each file and sends the
 *     bytes to the console, which writes them into the store. The bytes pass through
 *     the PC. A task not delivered within its lease goes back to the queue.
 * A job's items are saved as they finish (library/.jobs/<id>.job), so a job cut short
 * (a restart, a closed helper, a cancel) resumes without redoing finished items. */
