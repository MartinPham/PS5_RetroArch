/* PS5 RetroArch - what a frontend executable's link needs beyond the payload SDK.

 *
 * The compiler's builtins archive on this host (clang 23) is built with
 * _FORTIFY_SOURCE, so its emulated thread-locals (emutls.c, which SDL2 and the
 * OpenGL SDK pull in) call __memset_chk, which the console's libc does not have.
 * The check is the caller's buffer size; this keeps it.
 *
 * faccessat: libc++'s std::filesystem asks with it (ES-DE's MiximageGenerator), and
 * the console's libc has none. access() itself is the platform's here (bound by
 * tools/build-frontend.sh), the console's refusing every path a title asks about.
 *
 * iswctype_l: libc++ classifies wide characters through it with FreeBSD's ctype
 * masks (_CTYPE_S for a space; ctype_byname<wchar_t>::do_is, which a named
 * std::locale reaches while it builds its time facets). The platform's
 * ps5_iswctype_l hands the mask to the console's iswctype, which is Dinkumware's
 * (it exports _Iswctype and _Getpwctytab) and reads its argument as an index into
 * its class table: ES-DE's std::locale("C") faulted there on its first line
 * (klog/run-PPSA99169-154622.log: SIGSEGV in libSceLibcInternal, c 0x20, mask
 * 0x4000). This answers from the platform's FreeBSD rune type, as FreeBSD does.
 *
 * pathconf: libc++'s std::filesystem::current_path sizes its buffer with it, and
 * only libkernel_sys exports it, which a title does not load: the import would be
 * null. The limits are the console's FreeBSD ones, for a path that exists.
 *
 * getcwd: the platform's ps5_getcwd finds the working directory by walking up
 * from "." and listing each parent, which failed in the title's sandbox; ES-DE,
 * given no working directory, recursed until its stack ran out
 * (klog/run-PPSA99169-160106.log). A frontend sets its working directory once,
 * with ps5_frontend_chdir and an absolute path, and getcwd answers with that path;
 * before it does, getcwd is the platform's. The console refuses chdir to a title
 * (EPERM, klog/frontend-20261004-161318/es-de-ps5.log), so until that changes
 * getcwd stays the platform's.
 *
 * lstat: refused to a title (EPERM) for every path; ES-DE asks it of every theme
 * file through std::filesystem::is_symlink and logged 13,686 refusals in one
 * start (klog/frontend-20261004-161318/es_log.txt). A title has no symbolic links
 * (the platform refuses symlink and finds none with readlink), so lstat answers
 * as stat. The platform's getcwd walks the tree with it too.
